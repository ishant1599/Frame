      which makes it impressively easy to use. With its help, your site can scale up and<br>

      pieces of your <br>site’s content or make it visible to your visitors by means of
       using necessary classes to phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Responsivity</h3>
    <p>Taking into consideration the growing demand in using handheld devices for web access,

         element of all websites and web Apps that are intended to scale up and down
